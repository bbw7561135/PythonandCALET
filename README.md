# Interpretation of Electron Spectrum Measured by [CALET](https://calet.jp/). 

This repo contains some of the codes used for the interpreation of  CALET electron + AMS-02 positron flux. Both DM and Pulsar models can explain the measurement. 

Later I have uploaded my personal understanding of PCA analysis with background 
parameters obtained from fitting to CALET simulated data. This are only for understanding the correlation 
of background parameters only.
