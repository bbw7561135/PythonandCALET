This project contains some of the important files used in our 
science data analysis of CALET data. 

From generating 5 years simulated CALET data to fitting pulsar model
to this 5000 simulated samples to obtain a chi square is also uploaded here. 

Later I have uploaded my personal understanding of PCA analysis with background 
parameters obtained from fitting to CALET simulated data. This are only for understanding the correlation 
of background parameters only.
