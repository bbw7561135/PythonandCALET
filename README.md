# Interpretation of Electron Spectrum Measured by [CALET](https://calet.jp/). 

This repo contains some of the codes used for the interpreation of  CALET electron + AMS-02 positron flux. Both 3-body leptonic decay of a Dark Matter and generic single young Pulsar source can explain the measurement. 

Below is an 800 GeV DM model decaying to 89% electron channel and 11% muon channel that can explain CALET + AMS-02 measurement. Background cut-off energy is fixed at 2 TeV.

Similarly single pulsar parametrization fit to CALET + AMS-02 Data for a backgroun cut-off 10 TeV is shown below

It is shown that using simulated CALET data for 5 years and using simple statistical method (AIC) DM model cannot be separated from Pulsar model. Details of the results are published in [International Journal of Modern Physics D](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S0218271819500354)

Later I have uploaded my personal understanding of PCA analysis with background 
parameters obtained from fitting to CALET simulated data. This are only for understanding the correlation 
of background parameters only. Planning to include a notebook later on for complete understanding.
