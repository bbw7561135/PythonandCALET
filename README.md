# Interpretation of Electron Spectrum Measured by [CALET](https://calet.jp/). 

This repo contains some of the codes used for the interpreation of  CALET electron + AMS-02 positron flux. Both DM and Pulsar models can explain the measurement. 
Below is ![800 GeV DM model fit to CALET data](https://github.com/suvoooo/PythonandCALET/blob/master/DMModelC_refcomment1.png), background cut-off energy is fixed at 2 TeV. 

Similarly single pulsar parametrization fit to CALET + AMS-02 Data for a backgroun cut-off 10 TeV is shown ![below](https://github.com/suvoooo/PythonandCALET/blob/master/pulbestfitEd10TeV/bestfitEd10TeVEpwn700GeVs0d05phi0d5.png)

It is shown that using simulated CALET data for 5 years and using simple statistical method (AIC) DM model cannot be separated from Pulsar model. Details of the results are published in [International Journal of Modern Physics D](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S0218271819500354)

Later I have uploaded my personal understanding of PCA analysis with background 
parameters obtained from fitting to CALET simulated data. This are only for understanding the correlation 
of background parameters only. Planning to include a notebook later on for complete understanding.
